# extract-text-webpack-plugin

Ever since we started requiring CSS from JS, we've had this annoying problem:
when the page loads... *just* for a second... there's no CSS! Oof! Ugly!

This is because the CSS is packaged *inside* our JavaScript... so we need to wait
for it to download and be executed.

This is ok for development, but we *cannot* have this on production. The fix involves
one of the most *important* plugins in all of Webpack: the
`extract-text-webpack-plugin`. It has a weird name.... but has one simple job:
it outputs a *real* CSS file, instead of embedding CSS in JavaScript.

Let's get it rocking! Find your terminal and run

```terminal
yarn add extract-text-webpack-plugin --dev
```

## Current Setup: style-loader

Now open up `webpack.config.js`. Remember: CSS is processed via *loaders*. If a
file ends in `.css`, it goes through the `css-loader` and then the `style-loader`.
For Sass, it's basically the same: the `sass-loader`, `resolve-url-loader`, then
the same `css-loader` and `style-loader`.

The `style-loader` is the key: it embeds the CSS so that it's added to the page
as a `style` tag. Basically, we need to *replace* the `style-loader` with something
that, instead, outputs a real CSS file. That's *exactly* what the `extract-text-webpack-plugin`
does!

Bring in the package with `const ExtractTextPlugin = require('extract-text-webpack-plugin')`.

## The Loaders: ExtractTextPlugin.extract()

Now, under the loaders for `.css` files, *remove* the two loaders and, instead,
add `ExtractTextPlugin.extract()` and pass that some options. First,
`use` set to `cssLoader`. And then, `fallback` set to `styleLoader`.

Ignore the `fallback` key for a moment. Basically, the `extract()` function is a
fancy way to prepend the loaders in `use` with a special `extract-text-webpack-plugin`
loader. Thanks to this, CSS files will be processed through `css-loader` and then
through this new extract text loader.

The `styleLoader`, which is set on `fallback`, is not used at all anymore. Well,
actually, this is one of the least important, but most confusing parts about the
plugin. Later, when we talk about code splitting, I'll explain what the `fallback`
option *really* does. But for now, the `styleLoader` is no longer used. So, no more
style tags!

Repeat this for Sass. I'll copy the three loaders and then say
`ExtractTextPlugin.extract()`, passing that `use` set to those 3 loaders and
`fallback` set again to `styleLoader`.

## Adding the Plugin

The *last* step is to activate all of this down in the `plugins` section. Add
`new ExtractTextPlugin()` and pass it a special name: `[name].css`.

Let's see what this does! Find your webpack tab and restart the dev server:

```terminal-silent
./node_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server
```

When it finishes, scroll up to the output. In addition to `login.js`, there is a
`login.css`! And a `layout.css` and a `rep_log.css`. Our CSS is *no* longer packaged
inside JavaScript: each entry now has its own CSS file!

***TIP
If a JavaScript entry file does not require *any* CSS, no `.css` file will be
output by Webpack.

## Adding the link Tags

This will fix our CSS flashing problem! But... with a downside: we now need to manually
include `link` tags along with our `script` tags. In `base.html.twig`, add a `link`
tag for `build/layout.css`.

Copy that. We need to do this again on our two pages:
`app/Resources/FOSUserBundle/views/security/login.html.twig`. Override the block
`stylesheets`, call `parent()` and add the `link` tag to `login.css`.

Do all of this again in `index.html.twig`. This time we need to point to `rep_log.css`.

I think we're ready! Refresh the page. Yes! No CSS delay! View the source and click
on `rep_log.css`. Yep! It's a beautiful, traditional CSS file.

## We Killed HMR!

But... I have some bad news. We just killed hot module replacement! If you make
a change and move over to your browser... it says "Nothing hot updated" and
"App is up to date".

Yep, `extract-text-webpack-plugin` and HMR are incompatible. Boooo! There *is* a
plugin to make this all work - [css-hot-loader](https://github.com/shepherdwind/css-hot-loader),
but it's pretty young and I haven't tested it yet. If you like HMR, try it out!

But, how is it possible that two *super* important features like extract text and
HMR don't work together?! Well, the official answer is that `extract-text-webpack-plugin`
should only be used for your production build - not during development. We'll talk
about production builds next.

But I don't like that! If we *don't* use `extract-text-webpack-plugin` while developing,
then my site will look great... *even* if I completely forget to add my `link` tag!
I might only discover a page is ugly after deploying it to production. That's why
I always enable the plugin. But, if you like HMR and you can't get it to work with
that other plugin, disabling it during development *is* a valid option.

For us, I'm going to stop using the `webpack-dev-server`. At the top of `webpack.config.js`,
set `useDevServer` to false. And then, in `app/config/config.yml`, comment out
the `base_url` stuff.

Yep, we'll use the tried and true `webpack --watch`:

```terminal-silent
./node_modules/.bin/webpack --watch
```
