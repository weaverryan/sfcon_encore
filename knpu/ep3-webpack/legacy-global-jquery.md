# Legacy Libraries & global jQuery

Now that `layout.js` is being processed through webpack, we can remove our
self-executing function and replace the `$` with `const $ = require('jquery')`.

We rock! But this time... there's a surprise. When we refresh, we do *not* get warm,
fuzzy feelings: we get a cold and not-so-fuzzy error:

> $.tooltip() is not a function

Interesting! This `$.tooltip()` function *should* be coming from Bootstrap... which
is included in our base layout. So... why isn't this working? Well... think about
it: Bootstrap's job is to *modify* `jQuery` and add more functions to it, like
`tooltip`. But, in `layout.js`, we require a *different*, *fresh*, unmodified jQuery
and then try to call `.tooltip()` on it!

That doesn't work because - when the Bootstrap code is loaded - it modifies the
jQuery that's loaded in our *layout*: it modifies the *global* jQuery variable.
In `layout.js`, we're *not* using the global `jQuery` variable: we're requiring
our *own* jQuery... which has *not* been modified by Bootstrap.

The fix? We already know it: we need to once again handle all our dependencies
*inside* `layout.js`. I mean, if we need bootstrap functions inside of this file,
then we need to *require* bootstrap here.

Let's do it!

## Installing and Requiring Bootstrap

First, install Bootstrap:

```terminal
yarn add bootstrap --dev
```

Then, in `layout.js`, this is interesting: just say `require('bootstrap')`. Nope,
I'm not setting this to a variable. This is really common with jQuery plugins, like
Bootstrap. These files don't actually *return* anything. Instead, we require them
so that they *modify* the jQuery function and add new functions to it.

We should be good, right? Try it! Ah!!! The same cold, unfuzzy error! This is confusing.

## Modules that Rely on Global Variables

To see what's really going on, open the base layout and remove the `script` tags
for `jQuery` and `bootstrap`. We don't need these anymore: we've refactored all
of our code to properly *require* what we need instead of relying on global variables.

And when we refresh now, the *new* error is a bit more helpful:

> jQuery is not defined

The *source* of this isn't clear at first, but this is coming from *Bootstrap*.
This is where Webpack gets tricky.

The `bootstrap` module *relies* on there to be a *global* `jQuery` variable. Yep,
it's behaving poorly.

Look, in a perfect world, when we require bootstrap, internally, *it* would use
the `require` function to `require` jQuery and then modify it. See, if multiple
files require the same module - like `jquery`, they are all returned the *same*
object. This means that Bootstrap would add the `tooltip` function to the same
`jquery` that we use in `layout.js`.

But.... that doesn't happen. Instead, Bootstrap looks for a *global* jQuery variable
to modify. If there is *no* global variable - like in our nice system - it explodes.

## Fixing Poorly-Behaving Modules

There are a *few* ways to fix this. First, we could say `window.jQuery = $` before
requiring bootstrap. If we try that and refresh, no more errors! Yep, we require
the `jquery` module and then make it a global variable *just* in time for Bootstrap
to look for it.

But there are a few problems with this... the biggest being that I *don't* want to
keep relying on global variables! And second... we're probably going to face this
issue again and again... with other jQuery plugins. I'd rather have a more *global*
way of fixing this.

How? Through the power of Webpack!
